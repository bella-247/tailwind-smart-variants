Tailwind Smart Variants Improvement Roadmap
Phase 1: Core Improvements (High impact, feasible)

Focus: Make the library usable, reliable, and developer-friendly.

API Ergonomics & Documentation

Provide clear, minimal examples for beginners.

Offer “quick-start” usage with just base + condition.

Include examples combining pseudo-classes and responsive breakpoints.

✅ Difficulty: Medium

🕒 Time estimate: 1–2 weeks

Debuggability

Ensure consistent order of merged classes.

Optionally provide a debug output showing the source of each class (base, hover, condition).

Test outputs in browser for predictability.

✅ Difficulty: Medium

🕒 Time estimate: 1 week

Performance Optimization

Optimize object traversal and string concatenation.

Precompute static cases if possible.

Benchmark against plain className strings.

✅ Difficulty: Medium–Hard

🕒 Time estimate: 1–2 weeks

TypeScript Typings

Provide full typings for twSmart.

Ensure IntelliSense works for base, hover, sm, md, etc.

✅ Difficulty: Medium

🕒 Time estimate: 1 week

Phase 2: Enhancements (Optional, more challenging)

Focus: Add advanced features for power users and wider adoption.

Integration with Tailwind Plugins & Custom Themes

Support passing a theme object to twSmart.

Allow detecting user-defined Tailwind plugin classes.

Partial support may be enough initially.

✅ Difficulty: Hard

🕒 Time estimate: 2–3 weeks

Conditional Classes Best Practices

Provide helper functions for common patterns like toggling multiple classes.

Encourage using condition instead of inline ternaries.

✅ Difficulty: Easy–Medium

🕒 Time estimate: 1 week

Responsive + Pseudo-Class Nested Objects

Enable clean nesting for readability, e.g., { sm: { hover: 'bg-blue-600' } }.

Ensure predictable merged class output.

✅ Difficulty: Medium

🕒 Time estimate: 1–2 weeks

Examples / Starter Projects

React, Next.js, and plain HTML demo projects.

Show best practices and edge cases.

✅ Difficulty: Easy

🕒 Time estimate: 1 week

Phase 3: Advanced Features (High difficulty, optional for now)

Focus: Cutting-edge integration for pro developers.

SSR / Static Extraction Compatibility

Ensure classes are known at build time for Tailwind JIT / PurgeCSS.

Could require AST parsing or Babel/TypeScript plugin.

⚠️ Difficulty: Very Hard

🕒 Time estimate: 3–5 weeks

IDE Autocomplete / Tailwind IntelliSense Support

Generate TypeScript types from Tailwind config.

Enable developers to get full autocomplete inside twSmart.

⚠️ Difficulty: Hard–Very Hard

🕒 Time estimate: 3–4 weeks

Ecosystem Differentiation

Highlight combined support for condition + responsive + pseudo + theme in docs.

Optionally provide migration guide from clsx, cva, etc.

✅ Difficulty: Easy–Medium

🕒 Time estimate: 1 week

Phase Prioritization

Phase 1: Must do → Usable, reliable, fast, type-safe.

Phase 2: Should do → Integration, nested objects, clear examples.

Phase 3: Optional for now → SSR, IntelliSense, full differentiation.
